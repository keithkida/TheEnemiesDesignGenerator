What the tool generates (plain language, keep it non-technical).
Creates a fully customized enemy based on user selected parameters and randomized visual traits and size. Uses weighted randomness, having certain design variants of the decided traits appear more often depending on the role chosen. 

How to run or access the tool (setup steps, controls, or links).
Runs directly inside the Unity scene with UI panels to change the parameter. When you first open the generator on unity, run it for the first time, and press generate without any parameters decided it will only show a blank white enemy without any trait, so it is best to first decide what mood, role, and trait it will have before generating so that it will show what enemy you want.

Parameter explanations (what each parameter does and how changing it affects output).

Parameters:

  Mood: (color variant)
  
  Anger: red variation of color
  
  Sad: blue variation of color
  
  Calm: green variation of color
  
  Happy: pink variation of color
  
Role: (size)

  Minion: small size enemy
  
  Leader: medium size enemy
  
  Boss: large size enemy
  
Trait: 

  Strength 💪: bigger arms variation
  
  Speed 👟: better leg variation

Known limitations (what the tool does not do yet or where it breaks).
Some limitation that this has is that it cannot use more than 2 traits. This makes it so that it needs another set of the same items to make a secondary trait making me need to have a total of 32 differernt traits


Evidence of external usage or playtesting:

Jonathan:

  add camera movements
  
  add labels for both trait dropdown
  
Micheal Tang:

  Color knob: make color selection easier
     update the color by actually pressing the generate button
    
  Can the enemies be exportable?
  
TA:

  Have the generations be more procedural rather than just produce one result
  
  have weights on different results of the generated traits on the enemy
  
  have sub details added depending on what details on traits were given
  
  When generating the different roles of the enemy, have them be different size as you try to generate a new design for that role
